# Model Checkpoints
This directory is intended to store the model checkpoints.

## Instructions
1.  Download the checkpoints from [![Zenodo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zenodo-10.5281/zenodo.16730061-blue)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16730061)
.
2.  Unzip the downloaded archive.
3.  Place all the checkpoint files directly into this folder.

The final structure should look like this:
```
checkpoints/
├── checkpoint_1.pt
├── checkpoint_2.pt
├── ...
└── README.md
```
